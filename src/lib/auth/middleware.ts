 *       return sql`select * from todos where user_id = ${context.userId}`;
 *     });
 *
 * Signed out with auth on (live preview included) -> throws `UnauthorizedError`
 * (see `verify.server.ts`). With auth disabled (`VITE_AUTH_ENABLED=false`, the
 * shipped default) it resolves the shared dev user — but throws instead when a
 * `DATABASE_URL` is also set, so an app without sign-in must not use this at
 * all. On the auth-on path, use it on every server function that touches
 * per-user data and scope every query by `context.userId`.
